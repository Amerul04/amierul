	<h2>Experience</h2>
	<p>Last year, I went to visit Hat Yai which is one of a vibrant city in southern Thailand with my family.Unlike the bustling streets of Bangkok, Hat Yai offered a very unique blend of cultural diversity, street food delights, and lively markets that made the trip truly unforgettable.</p>

<p>One of the most unique aspects of Thailand is its culture and traditions. Everywhere I went, I noticed lots of beautiful Buddhist temples, each with intricate carvings and golden statues that reflected the country’s deep spiritual roots.</p>

<p>Nexy,the most unforgetable things in Hatyai  was their food culture. Hat Yai is famous for their street food markets, where I tried dishes like fried chicken, tom yum soup, and coconut pancakes. The flavors were bold, sweet, spicy, and tangy all at once, showcasing the country’s distinctive culinary style.</p>

<p>Overall, my trip to Hat Yai was memorable not just because of the sights, but because it gave me an experience of Thai’s culture,food and lifestyle. It was an experience that left me with unforgettable memories and a desire to explore more of this fascinating country.</p>
